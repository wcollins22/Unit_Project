Unit 4 Project by Logan C, Justin and Will

Goal: To create a Facebook like website to where the user can view pages from Basecamp students

Thought Process: Since we only had two days to work on the project we decided to split up the work and have Justin work on a sparate project so we have something to present while, Logan and Will worked on the main project to show off more techinical skills
